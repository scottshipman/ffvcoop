Theory for recurring orders
*****************************
1. Add to cart appends pickup date field to all line items (then line item report can be based on pickup date + charged order status)
2. hook checkout form to add an option for recurring (select # of weeks)
3. Hook checkout submit process to add orders with "recurring-pending" status cloned from current order.
4. Cron job gets all recurring-pending orders and processes payment - updates status.

Delivery Module
 - make delivery pane required when visible

Orders:
  Verify all status names for line item report status check

Weekly Email (views Send)
  - Update to use users + customers


Annual Fee Module (probably handled with rules)
 - create Annual Fee Product (Product>Fees)
 - widget to clear Fee Paid field
 - Auto Add to Order if not paid and has at least 1 order.


Add Refund Policy, Terms and Conditions, SSL Checkout, Privacy Policy, text about Fee on Register page
