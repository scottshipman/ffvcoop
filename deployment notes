Theory for recurring orders
*****************************
1. Add to cart appends pickup date field to all line items (then line item report can be based on pickup date + charged order status)
2. hook checkout form to add an option for recurring (select # of weeks)
3. Hook checkout submit process to add orders with "recurring-pending" status cloned from current order.
4. Cron job gets all recurring-pending orders and processes payment - updates status.
